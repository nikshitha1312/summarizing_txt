Meeting Transcript - Q4 Planning Session
Date: December 15, 2024
Participants: John Smith (CEO), Sarah Johnson (CTO), Mike Davis (CFO), Lisa Chen (Head of Marketing)

John Smith: Good morning everyone, welcome to our Q4 planning session. Let's start by reviewing our Q3 performance and then discuss our goals for Q4.

Sarah Johnson: Thanks John. From a technical perspective, Q3 was quite successful. We launched the new mobile app which saw 150% increase in user engagement. Our cloud infrastructure migration is 80% complete, and we've reduced system downtime by 60%.

Mike Davis: Financially, we exceeded our Q3 revenue targets by 12%. However, our customer acquisition costs increased by 8% due to higher marketing spend. We need to optimize this in Q4.

Lisa Chen: The marketing team agrees with Mike's assessment. We've identified that our social media campaigns are underperforming. We're planning to shift 30% of our budget to influencer partnerships and content marketing.

John Smith: Excellent insights. For Q4, I want us to focus on three main areas: expanding into the European market, improving customer retention, and launching our AI-powered features.

Sarah Johnson: The AI features are ready for beta testing. We've developed a recommendation engine and automated customer support chatbot. We should launch the beta in January.

Mike Davis: For European expansion, we'll need an additional $500,000 budget for legal compliance, localization, and initial marketing campaigns.

Lisa Chen: I've already started researching European market trends. Germany and France show the highest potential. We should prioritize these markets first.

John Smith: Great work everyone. Let's set these as our Q4 priorities:
1. Launch AI features beta in January
2. Begin European market entry in February
3. Implement customer retention program
4. Optimize marketing spend to reduce CAC

Sarah Johnson: I'll coordinate the AI beta launch with the product team.

Mike Davis: I'll prepare the budget proposal for European expansion.

Lisa Chen: I'll develop the European marketing strategy and customer retention program.

John Smith: Perfect. Let's meet again in two weeks to review progress. Any questions or concerns?

Sarah Johnson: None from the tech team.

Mike Davis: I'll need the final budget numbers by next Friday.

Lisa Chen: Marketing team is good to go.

John Smith: Excellent. Meeting adjourned. Thank you everyone for your hard work.
